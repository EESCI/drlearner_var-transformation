# Variable transformations and DR-Learner

This repository contains code files for exploring the impact of covariate transformations on estimating ATE and CATE using the DR-Learner. Two empirical datasets are used in this example.

The repository includes several code files:

- A data management file that creates a subset of the NuMoM2b dataset.

This repository is currently under development and is a work in progress.
